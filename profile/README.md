## 🧠 Designed for Robotics Teams

Software deployment in robotics is fundamentally different from traditional IT. Most DevOps tools were never designed with robots in mind.

At Robotair, we've experienced firsthand the challenges of deploying software to robots in production and scaling fleets to thousands of units. We’ve built the tooling we wished we had so you don’t have to.

### 💡 What We Offer

- **🔁 Cloud-native CI/CD workflows for ROS 1 & ROS 2**
  Build your robot software automatically on every code change.
  Run tests, format checks, dependency resolution, and container builds through a clean pipeline without having to maintain custom GitHub/GitLab CI scripts.

- **🎯 Reliable Over-the-Air (OTA) Deployments**
  Push software updates to your robots no matter where they are lab, factory, or the field.
  Use Robotair to deploy new versions with rollback safety, staged rollouts, and full version history tracking. No SSH, no SD cards, no manual intervention.

- **🌐 Robot Fleet Management**
  Register robots once and manage them from a central dashboard.
  Group robots by use-case, configuration, or hardware, assign them to projects, and execute deployments to selected groups or entire fleets with a click or CLI command.

- **📊 Robot Monitoring: Metrics & Logs**
  Monitor the health of your deployed applications in real time.
  Track CPU usage, memory, disk space, container status, and view live logs across all robots from one place. Helps you catch issues early and fix them faster.

- **🧩 Cross-Architecture Hardware Support**
  Build once, deploy everywhere across Jetson, x86\_64 desktops, Raspberry Pi, and other ARM-based systems.
  Robotair handles cross-compilation and Docker image targeting, so you don’t need different pipelines for each robot type.

- **🏗️ Scalable, Production-Ready Infrastructure**
  Use the same system from prototyping to production, no need to re-architect later.
  Whether you have 1 robot or 1000, Robotair is built to scale, with robust infrastructure for updates, monitoring, and CI that grows with your fleet.

- **🔧 Minimal DevOps Maintenance Required**
  You don’t need to be a DevOps engineer to deploy and manage robot software.
  Robotair sets up your deployment pipeline, manages runners, and handles infrastructure behind the scenes so your team stays focused on robotics development, not tooling.
